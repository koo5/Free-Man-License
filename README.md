The intent of this license is to encourage <work on this> while ..
, to strike a balance between the foot funghi eating hippies and authors existential needs.




It should avoid the pitfalls outlined in
http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses/NC#The_Case_for_Free_Use:_Reasons_Not_to_Use_a_Creative_Commons_-NC_License

1.Incompatibility:

this license isn't non-commercial. Sale and any kind of reuse is
encouraged. providing services and content covered by this license does
not constitute "use", and is encouraged. license notice is required by

law, to protect users from unknowingly violating it. (from the author)
(sucks, but in a semantic world, hopefully less)

2. Basic and beneficial uses:
solved by "over 7 permanent users"
solved by "if i don't spot you, it's allright" (only going after the big fish)


comment: you can make money reselling the work,

todo:
 go thru the against-NC article again, add titles, quotes
 explicit discusson on projects killed by stupid licenses

Lemon comes with this weird license because i can't justify to myself
spending so much time working on it with no hope of any income ever.
I know there are "secondary" ways to make money on open source projects,
but in my situation and medical condition, and with the "meta", "take-over-
the-world" nature of the project, they don't seem realistic.
If you think we can work something out, i'm all ears, as well as if you
want to contribute under your conditions.

This is just a preliminary sketch that wouldn't pass as a proper license.
You have to accept future modifications and rewrites.
