introduction
===
Lemon comes with this weird license because i can't justify to myself
spending so much time working on it with no hope of returns.
I know there are "secondary" ways to make money on open source projects,
but in my medical condition, and with the "meta", "take-over-
the-world" nature of the project, they don't seem realistic.
The program's main goal is to be self-explanatory, easily extended, need no on-site training, no support.
Also, trying to prove that licenses and lawyerspeak can work for people. I appreciate any discussion.
if you want to contribute to the program under your conditions instead, i hope we can work something out. Going with a standard open source license is an option, too.

This is just a preliminary sketch that wouldn't pass for a proper license.



notes
===

The intent of this license is to encourage <work on this> while ..

avoiding pitfalls outlined in
http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses/NC#The_Case_for_Free_Use:_Reasons_Not_to_Use_a_Creative_Commons_-NC_License

1.Incompatibility:

this license isn't non-commercial. Sale and any kind of reuse is
encouraged. providing services and content covered by this license does
not constitute "use", and is encouraged. license notice is required by
law, to protect users from unknowingly violating it. (from the author)
(sucks, but in a semantic world, hopefully less)

2. Basic and beneficial uses:
solved by "over 7 permanent users"
solved by "if i don't spot you, it's allright" (only going after the big fish)

comment: you can make money reselling the work,

 projects killed by stupid licenses


versioning - this work is always published under the current version of the license ... 

contributor agreement?
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement
	'''With the Harmony CLA, "the contributor gives Canonical a licence to use their contributions. The contributor continues to own the copyright in the contribution, with full rights to re-use, re-distribute, and continue modifying the contributed code, allowing them to also share that contribution with other projects.'''

	technically, maybe CLA isnt necessary and could be just made part of the license?

base price on cost of living instead (of the permanent users?)
