introduction
===
i love working on lemon but wont be able to do it for free forever.
usual open source business models dont fit, if anything of
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_models_for_open-source_software becomes viable, the vision of lemon has failed. The program's main goal is to be self-explanatory, easily extended, need no on-site training, no support.

Also, trying to prove that licenses and lawyerspeak can work for people. I appreciate any discussion.
if you want to contribute to the program under your conditions instead, i hope we can work something out. Going with a standard open source license is an option too.

These are just preliminary notes that wouldn't pass as a proper license.



notes
===

The intent of this license is to encourage <work on this> while ..

avoiding pitfalls outlined in
http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses/NC#The_Case_for_Free_Use:_Reasons_Not_to_Use_a_Creative_Commons_-NC_License

1.Incompatibility:

this license isn't non-commercial. Sale and any kind of reuse is
encouraged. providing services and content covered by this license does
not constitute "use", and is encouraged. license notice is required by
law, to protect users from unknowingly violating it. (from the author)
(sucks, but in a semantic world, hopefully less)

2. Basic and beneficial uses:
solved by "over 7 permanent users"
solved by "if i don't spot you, it's allright" (only going after the big fish)

comment: you can make money reselling the work,

todo:
 go thru the against-NC article again, add titles, quotes
 projects killed by stupid licenses


versioning - this work is always published under the current version of the license ... 

contributor agreement?
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement
	'''With the Harmony CLA, "the contributor gives Canonical a licence to use their contributions. The contributor continues to own the copyright in the contribution, with full rights to re-use, re-distribute, and continue modifying the contributed code, allowing them to also share that contribution with other projects.'''
	http://www.clahub.com/
	technically, maybe CLA isnt necessary and could be just made part of the license?

base price on cost of living instead (of the permanent users?)

free man license revision 0

this software is 

define core authors?

core authors can, at their option, publish this work or parts of it under a Free Software Foundation approved license (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html) (or other license?)

share alike,

commercial use
	in companies with permanently over 7 users: 
	$1/user/year
	covers any number of works covered by this license used

free for all other purposes and uses

you can distribute and sell, modify, yada yada

what is derived work?

half of the collected money goes to the Free Software Foundation or other (open source?) projects at the core authors option? your option?



notes: donation. the roof

how to define a user? basically give up and charge for only well-definable (desktop) use?
dual licensing, crudely something like CC-NC + additional permissions for non-heavy use + a commercial license?
maybe heavily adapt GPL
